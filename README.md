Wordpress is one of the most popular blogs of the blog service in the world. In this project, we want to train a recommender system to predict which user will like which post between thousands of active blogs.<br/>
Today, the importance of weblogs and its effects on the people's lives is undeniable and due to the popularity of weblogs, posts as well as the importance of users ' time and such active role in people 's lives, a recommender system can be helpful.
Answering the question " who would like it ? " has many advantages, including the convenience of users to avoid wasting their time.<br/>
So, this project is designed for predicting which people will "like" which blog posts from across 90k active blogs on WordPress.com.
